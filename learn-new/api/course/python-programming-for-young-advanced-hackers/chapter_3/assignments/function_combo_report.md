# Practice: Function Combo Mini Report

In this practice you will combine several built-in functions in one small "status report" program.

## Your Mission

Open `function_combo_report.py` in the editor.

1. There will be some starter variables, like:

   ```python
   name = "Boss Dragon"
   danger = -10
   accuracy = 9.8765
   ```

2. Use these built-in functions at least once each:
   - `len`
   - `abs`
   - `round`
   - `type`
3. Create a mini report using `print`, for example:

   ```python
   print("Name:", name)
   print("Name length:", len(name))
   print("Danger distance:", abs(danger))
   print("Rounded accuracy:", round(accuracy, 2))
   print("Type of danger:", type(danger))
   ```

4. Feel free to add more variables and more lines to your report.

## Checklist

- [ ] I used `len`, `abs`, `round`, and `type` at least once.
- [ ] I printed a clear multi-line status report.
- [ ] My program runs without errors.

You just built a tiny dashboard powered by functions!
