# Mission: Cinema Access Checker

Decide if someone is allowed to watch a PG-13 movie.

## What your program should do

1. Start with variables like:
   - `age` (for example: `12`)
   - `is_with_adult` (True/False)
   - `has_permission_note` (True/False)
2. Use **logical operators** to decide if the person can watch the movie:
   - They are allowed if **age >= 13** OR `is_with_adult` is True OR `has_permission_note` is True.
3. If they are allowed, print:
   - `Welcome!`
4. Otherwise, print:
   - `Sorry, not allowed.`

## Hints

- Use `or` to allow any of the conditions.
- You can experiment with `and` and `not` in extra checks if you like.
