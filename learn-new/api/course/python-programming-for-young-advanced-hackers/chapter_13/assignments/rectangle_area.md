# Mission: Calculate Rectangle Area

Write a function that calculates the area of a rectangle.

## What your program should do

1. Define a function `rectangle_area(width, height)`.
2. Inside the function, calculate `width * height` and **return** the result.
3. In your main code, call `rectangle_area` for at least two different rectangles.
4. Print the areas and optionally compare which rectangle is bigger.

## Hints

- Use `return width * height` inside the function.
- Store the result in variables like `area1` and `area2`.
