# Mission: Even Squares with List Comprehension

Use a list comprehension to get the squares of only the even numbers.

## What your program should do

1. Start with a list `numbers`, for example: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.
2. Use a **list comprehension** to build a new list `even_squares` that contains `n * n` for each even `n`.
3. Print the result.

## Hints

- Remember the pattern: `[expression for item in iterable if condition]`.
- Use `n % 2 == 0` to test if `n` is even.
