# Mission: Super Calculator  Powers and Roots

Build a mini "super calculator" for a math-loving friend.

## What your program should do

1. Ask the user to enter a **positive number**.
2. Compute and print:
   - The number **squared** (to the power of 2).
   - The number **cubed** (to the power of 3).
   - The **square root** of the number.
3. Print each result in a clear sentence.

## Hints

- Use `import math` at the top of your file.
- Use `**` for powers:
  - `n ** 2` is `n` squared.
  - `n ** 3` is `n` cubed.
- Use `math.sqrt(n)` for the square root.

## Example (one possible run)

Input:

```text
Enter a positive number: 4
```

Possible output:

```text
Square: 16
Cube: 64
Square root: 2.0
```
