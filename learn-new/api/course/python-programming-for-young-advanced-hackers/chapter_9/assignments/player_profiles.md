# Mission: Player Profiles (Dictionaries)

Store data about a player in a dictionary.

## What your program should do

1. Create a dictionary called `player` with keys like `"name"`, `"level"`, and `"score"`.
2. Update the player's score to a higher value.
3. Print a summary sentence using an f-string, like:
   - `Player Alex is level 3 with score 120`

## Hints

- A dictionary looks like:
  - `player = {"name": "Alex", "level": 1, "score": 0}`
- Update values like this:
  - `player["score"] = 100`
- Use `player["name"]` to access values.
