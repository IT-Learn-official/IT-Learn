# Mission: Secret Name Tag

Create a secret hacker name from a first and last name.

## What your program should do

1. Start with two variables: `first_name` and `last_name`.
2. Use **slicing** to take part of each name (for example, the first 3 letters).
3. Combine the pieces into a `code_name` string.
4. Print a message using an **f-string**, like:
   - `Your hacker name is: ShaWizard`

## Hints

- You can slice the first three letters with `first_name[:3]`.
- You can join text with `+` or use an f-string.
- Try different slice lengths and see what looks cool!
