# Mission: Parentheses Power-Up

# This file is your expression lab.
# Add print statements with math expressions and use parentheses to
# control the order of operations.

# Start with these examples (you can uncomment and modify them):

# print("2 + 3 * 4 =", 2 + 3 * 4)
# print("(2 + 3) * 4 =", (2 + 3) * 4)

# print("10 - 4 / 2 =", 10 - 4 / 2)
# print("(10 - 4) / 2 =", (10 - 4) / 2)

# TODO: Add at least two more pairs of expressions of your own.
# Try using // (integer division) or % (remainder) in at least one of them.
