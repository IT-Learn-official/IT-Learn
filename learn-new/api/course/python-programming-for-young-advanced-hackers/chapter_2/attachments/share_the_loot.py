# Mission: Share the Loot

# You found a chest of coins in a game. Use Python to share the loot fairly.

# 1. Set up your starting numbers.
#    You can change these later to test different situations.

total_coins = 17
players = 4

# 2. Use integer division (//) and modulo (%) to compute the split.
#    coins_per_player should be how many whole coins each player gets.
#    leftover_coins should be how many coins are left in the chest.

# TODO: compute coins_per_player and leftover_coins

# 3. Print a friendly summary.
#    Example:
#    Each player gets 4 coins.
#    Leftover coins: 1

# TODO: print the results in human-readable sentences
