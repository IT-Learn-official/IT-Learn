# Assignment: Understanding Database Structure

## 🎯 Objective
Understand how data is organized in database tables by exploring an existing table structure.

## 📋 Instructions

In this assignment, you'll explore the `hackers` table that contains information about various hackers in our system.

### Step 1: View All Data
First, let's see everything in the table. Write a query to select all columns from the `hackers` table.

**Your Task:**
```sql
-- Write your query here to see all data
```

### Step 2: Identify the Columns
After running the query above, you should see several columns. Answer these questions:

1. What columns exist in the `hackers` table?
2. Which column appears to be the primary key (unique identifier)?
3. How many rows (records) are in the table?

### Step 3: Analyze the Data
Look at the data and answer:
- What kind of information is stored in each column?
- Are there any patterns you notice?
- What do you think each column represents?

## ✅ Expected Learning Outcomes

After completing this assignment, you should be able to:
- Write a basic SELECT * query
- Identify columns in a table
- Understand how rows and columns organize data
- Recognize a primary key column

## 🎓 Bonus Challenge

Can you identify:
- Which hacker has the highest level?
- Are there any hackers with the same skill?
- What's the most common hacker type?

*Note: You don't need SQL for this yet - just observe the data!*

## 💡 Tips

- Take your time to read each row carefully
- Write down what you observe
- Think about why the data might be organized this way
- Consider how you might use this information in future queries

## 📝 Reflection Questions

1. Why do you think databases use tables instead of just text files?
2. What advantage does having a primary key (id) provide?
3. If you were designing this table, what other columns might you add?
