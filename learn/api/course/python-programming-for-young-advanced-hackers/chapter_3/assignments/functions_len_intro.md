# Practice: Counting Characters with len

In this practice you will use the built-in function `len` to count how many characters are in different strings.

## Your Mission

Open `functions_len_intro.py` in the editor.

1. Use the `len` function to find the length of at least **three** different strings.
   - For example: `"cat"`, `"dragon"`, `"Hello, world!"`.
2. Store each result in a variable.
   - Example: `length_cat = len("cat")`.
3. Use `print` to show helpful messages, like:

   ```python
   print("The word 'cat' has", length_cat, "characters.")
   ```

4. Make sure your program runs without errors.

## Checklist

- [ ] I called `len` at least 3 times.
- [ ] I stored each result in a variable.
- [ ] I used `print` to show the lengths with clear messages.
- [ ] I ran the code and saw the correct lengths in the output.

Have fun counting characters!
