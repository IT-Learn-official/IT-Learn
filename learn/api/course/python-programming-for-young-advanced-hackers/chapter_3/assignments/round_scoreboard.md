# Practice: Rounding the Scoreboard with round

In this practice you will use the built-in function `round` to make messy decimal numbers easier to read.

## Your Mission

Open `round_scoreboard.py` in the editor.

1. You will see some scores defined for you, like `raw_score = 3.14159` and `speed = 9.8765`.
2. Use `round` to create nicer versions of these numbers:
   - Round one number to a **whole number**.
   - Round another number to **2 decimal places**.
3. Store the rounded values in variables.
4. Use `print` to show a small "scoreboard", for example:

   ```python
   print("Raw score:", raw_score)
   print("Rounded score (2 decimals):", rounded_score)
   ```

## Checklist

- [ ] I used `round` with one argument (just the number).
- [ ] I used `round` with two arguments (number and decimal places).
- [ ] I stored the results in variables.
- [ ] I printed a clear scoreboard that shows original and rounded values.

Rounding helps your players read their scores more easily!
