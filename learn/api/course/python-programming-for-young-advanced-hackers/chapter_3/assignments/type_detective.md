# Practice: Type Detective with type

In this practice you will use the built-in function `type` to inspect different values.

## Your Mission

Open `type_detective.py` in the editor.

1. Some variables are already defined for you, like:

   ```python
   coins = 10
   health = 9.5
   player_name = "Alex"
   ```

2. Use the `type` function to find the type of each variable.
   - Example: `print(type(coins))`
3. Print a friendly message for each variable, for example:

   ```python
   print("coins is of type", type(coins))
   ```

4. Try to guess the type before you run the code, then check if you were right.

## Checklist

- [ ] I used `type` on at least 3 different variables.
- [ ] I printed the type information with clear messages.
- [ ] I can explain the difference between `int`, `float`, and `str`.

`type` is your debugging detective when something looks strange!
