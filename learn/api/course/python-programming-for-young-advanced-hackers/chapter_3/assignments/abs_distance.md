# Practice: Distance from Zero with abs

In this practice you will use the built-in function `abs` to find how far numbers are from zero.

## Your Mission

Open `abs_distance.py` in the editor.

1. There are some numbers already defined for you (like `step1 = -3` and `step2 = 5`).
2. Use the `abs` function to find the distance from zero for each number.
   - Example: `distance1 = abs(step1)`
3. Use `print` to show messages like:

   ```python
   print("The distance of", step1, "from zero is", distance1)
   ```

4. Do this for **at least two** different numbers, one negative and one positive.

## Checklist

- [ ] I used `abs` at least 2 times.
- [ ] I stored each result in a variable.
- [ ] I printed clear messages showing the original number and its distance from zero.
- [ ] My program runs without errors.

Remember: `abs(x)` is always zero or positive.
