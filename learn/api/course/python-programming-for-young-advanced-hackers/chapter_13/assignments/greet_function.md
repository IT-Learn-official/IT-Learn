# Mission: Write a Greeting Function

Turn your greeting code into a reusable function.

## What your program should do

1. Define a function `greet(name)` that prints a greeting including the `name`.
2. Call `greet` at least **two times** with different names.

## Hints

- Remember to use `def greet(name):` to define the function.
- Inside the function, use `print` with the `name` parameter.
- At the bottom of the file, call `greet("Alice")`, `greet("Bob")`, etc.
