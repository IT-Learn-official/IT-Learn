# Mission: Add Two Numbers (Return)

Write a function that adds two numbers and returns the result.

## What your program should do

1. Define a function `add(a, b)`.
2. Inside the function, calculate the sum of `a` and `b`.
3. Use `return` to send the sum back to the caller.
4. Call `add` with some numbers, store the result in a variable, and print it.

## Hints

- Use `result = a + b` and then `return result`.
- Or simply `return a + b`.
- Remember: `print` is different from `return`.
