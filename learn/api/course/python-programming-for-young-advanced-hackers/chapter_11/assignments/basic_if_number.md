# Mission: Check If a Number Is Big Enough

Write a tiny program that checks if a number is big enough.

## What your program should do

1. Start with a variable `number` (for example: `number = 12`).
2. Use an `if` statement to check if `number` is **greater than or equal to 10**.
3. If it is, print a message like:
   - `The number is big enough!`
4. If it is smaller than 10, you can either print nothing or print a different message.

## Hints

- Use `>=` to check "greater than or equal to".
- Make sure the code inside `if` is indented.
