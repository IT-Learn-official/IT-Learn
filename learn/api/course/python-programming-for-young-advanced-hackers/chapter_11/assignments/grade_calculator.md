# Mission: Grade Calculator

Turn a numeric score into a letter grade.

## What your program should do

1. Start with a variable `score` (0 to 100).
2. Use `if`, `elif`, and `else` to print a grade:
   - `A` if score is 90 or higher
   - `B` if score is 80–89
   - `C` if score is 70–79
   - `D` if score is 60–69
   - `F` if score is below 60

## Hints

- Check the highest grades first (A, then B, then C, ...).
- Make sure your ranges do **not** overlap.
- Use `>=` comparisons like `score >= 90`.
