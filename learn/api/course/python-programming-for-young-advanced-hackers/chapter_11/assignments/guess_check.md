# Mission: Simple Guess Check

Compare a guess to a secret number using if and else.

## What your program should do

1. Start with two variables:
   - `secret_number` (for example: `7`)
   - `guess` (you can start with any number)
2. Use an `if` statement to check if `guess` is **equal** to `secret_number`.
3. If they are equal, print:
   - `Correct!`
4. Otherwise (in `else`), print:
   - `Wrong guess!`

## Hints

- Use `==` to compare values.
- Use `if ... else ...` with proper indentation.
