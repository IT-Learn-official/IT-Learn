"""
Interpreted vs Compiled Detective
---------------------------------

Read the notes below and decide what each one describes.

For each language, answer these questions (in your head, on paper,
or by adding comments):
  - Is it a compiled language, interpreted language, or not
    really a programming language?
"""

# Python note:
#   You usually run .py files directly with an interpreter
#   (for example: python my_script.py). The code is executed
#   line by line.

# C++ note:
#   You write .cpp files and then use a compiler to turn them
#   into an executable program (like an .exe file) before you
#   can run it.

# HTML note:
#   You write .html files that describe how a web page should
#   look. A web browser reads these files and shows the page.

# Now decide:
#   - Which one is compiled?
#   - Which one is interpreted?
#   - Which one is not a programming language?
