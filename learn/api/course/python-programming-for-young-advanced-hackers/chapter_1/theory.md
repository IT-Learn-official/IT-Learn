# Chapter 1: Booting Up Your Python Powers

Welcome, young hacker. Your first mission, should you choose to accept it, is to learn the secret language of computers. In this chapter, you’ll stop being a regular user and start your journey to becoming a digital master.

By the end of this chapter, you’ll be able to:

- Explain what a **programming language** is (it’s your new superpower).
- Know the difference between **code** (the spells) and **programming** (the master plan).
- Understand why Python is an **interpreted** language (it’s fast and lets you experiment on the fly).
- Use Python in **interactive mode (REPL)** and **script mode**.
- Launch your first real Python script and make the machine greet you with `Hello, World!`.

## What is a Programming Language?

Imagine you have a secret agent who only understands a special code. You can't just tell them what to do in plain English; you need to use their secret language. Computers are like that agent, and **programming languages** are the secret codes. Python is one of the most powerful and popular secret languages in the world.

As a hacker, you'll use these languages to give computers instructions. These instructions are called **code**. It’s like writing a spell: you write the magic words, and the computer executes your command.

- **Your Goal:** "Computer, show me all the WiFi networks in the area."
- **The Code:** The exact Python lines that make the computer obey.

> **Key takeaway:** A programming language is how you command computers to do your bidding.

## Program vs. Code

People often mix these up, but a true hacker knows the difference:

- **Code:** These are the individual spells. The lines of text you write in a language like Python to make the computer do something specific.
- **Programming:** This is the master plan. It’s the art of figuring out *what* you want to do, breaking it down into steps, and then writing the code to execute those steps.

Real programmers don’t just mash keys. They:

1.  **Plan the mission:** "I'm going to build a bot that automatically joins my online classes."
2.  **Gather intel:** "What information does the bot need? The class link? The time?"
3.  **Create a strategy:** Break the big mission into smaller, manageable tasks.
4.  **Write the code:** *Then* they write the spells to make it all happen.

For example:

- **Programming (the plan):**
    - "Step 1: Ask the user for their name."
    - "Step 2: If they don’t enter a name, just say 'Hello, mysterious stranger!'"
    - "Step 3: Later, I'll add a feature to ask for their hacker alias."
- **Code (the spell):**
    - `name = input("Enter your name: ")`
    - `print("Hello, " + name + "!")`

> **Key takeaway:** **Programming** is the master plan. **Code** is the set of spells you write to execute it.

## Compiled vs. Interpreted Languages

Not all programming languages work the same way. There are two main types:

### Compiled Languages

Languages like **C++ or Java** are like building a robot from a blueprint. You write all the instructions, then a special program called a **compiler** translates everything into a single file (like an `.exe` on Windows). Once it's built, the robot can run on its own. But if you want to change anything, you have to rebuild the whole thing.

### Interpreted Languages

**Python** is an **interpreted** language. This is more like having a live conversation with your robot. You give it one command at a time, and it executes it immediately.

**Hacker Advantages:**
- **Speed:** You can test your ideas instantly. No waiting for a long build process.
- **Flexibility:** Change your code on the fly and see the results right away. This is perfect for experimenting and hacking things together.

> **Key takeaway:** Compiled languages are built all at once. Interpreated languages like Python are executed line by line, which is great for rapid hacking.

## About Python

Python was created by **Guido van Rossum** in the late 1980s. He named it after the British comedy group *Monty Python’s Flying Circus* because he wanted programming to be fun. (Spoiler: it is.)

**What can you do with Python?**
- Build websites and web apps.
- Create **video games**.
- Write **Discord bots** and automate your social life.
- Power **Artificial Intelligence** and machine learning.
- Automate boring stuff, like renaming thousands of files or sorting your downloads folder.

You’re learning the same tool used by pros at Google, NASA, and Netflix.

> **Key takeaway:** Python is a powerful, beginner-friendly language that can be used for everything from simple scripts to world-changing AI.

## Modes of Execution

There are two ways to wield your Python powers:

### 1. Interactive Mode (REPL)

The **REPL** (Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop) is your personal hacking sandbox. It’s like a direct chat with the Python interpreter.

- **Read:** Python reads your command.
- **Evaluate:** It executes your command.
- **Print:** It shows you the result.
- **Loop:** It waits for your next command.

You type `21 * 2` and Python instantly replies `42`. You type `"Hack the " + "Planet"` and it responds with `'Hack the Planet'`.

The REPL is perfect for testing small code snippets and getting instant feedback.

> **Key takeaway:** The REPL is your digital playground for quick experiments.

### 2. Script Mode

For bigger projects, you’ll save your code in a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `my_first_bot.py`). This is called **script mode**. A script is a complete set of instructions that Python executes from top to bottom.

Think of it as writing a full mission plan for your agent. When you run the script, the agent carries out the entire plan.

> **Key takeaway:** Script mode is for building real programs that you can save and run again and again.

## Your First Script

The first tradition for any aspiring hacker is to make the machine acknowledge you. The classic command is:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

When you run this, the computer will display `Hello, World!` on the screen. It’s your first step to making the machine do what *you* want.

In the upcoming practice missions, you’ll create this script, then learn to debug a broken one like a true digital detective.

> **Key takeaway:** `print(...)` is the spell you use to make Python talk.

## What’s Next?

You now have the foundational knowledge to start your hacking journey. It’s time to:

- Jump into the REPL and see what you can make Python do.
- Write and run your first script.
- Start thinking like a programmer by planning your missions before you write the code.

> **Achievement Unlocked:** You’re no longer just a user. You’re a programmer. Now let's go make the computer bend to your will.
