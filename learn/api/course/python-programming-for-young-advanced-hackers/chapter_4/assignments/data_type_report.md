# Mission: Data Type Report

You are writing a **data type report** for your game character.
Each important value has a **type**: number, text, or True/False.

## Starter idea

Create a few variables like:

```python
player_name = "Shadow"
level = 5
health = 9.5
is_alive = True
```

## Your tasks

1. Define at least **four** variables of different types:
   - One `str` (text)
   - One `int` (whole number)
   - One `float` (decimal number)
   - One `bool` (True/False)
2. For each variable, print a line that shows:
   - its name
   - its value
   - its type using `type()`

Example format (you can change the text):

```python
print("player_name =", player_name, "(type:", type(player_name), ")")
```

## Goal

When you run your script, you should see at least four lines, each clearly showing:

- The variable name
- The value
- The type (something like `<class 'str'>` or `<class 'int'>`)

Use this mission to practice **seeing** types while you code.
