# Mission: Type Scanner

In this mission, you will use your new **type scanner** ability: the `type()` function.

## Your tasks

1. Create a new Python script (or use the starter file).
2. Make at least **four** variables with different kinds of values:
   - One **int** (whole number), like `42`.
   - One **float** (decimal), like `3.14`.
   - One **string** that *looks* like a number, like `'123'`.
   - One **boolean**, like `True` or `False`.
3. For each variable, print its value **and** its type using `type()`.

Example idea (you can change the names and values):

```python
coins = 10
pi = 3.14
code = "123"
is_hacker = True

print(coins, type(coins))
print(pi, type(pi))
print(code, type(code))
print(is_hacker, type(is_hacker))
```

## Goal

When you run your script, you should see at least **four lines** of output, and each line should show both:

- the value
- the result of `type(...)`

Use this mission to get used to asking Python: **"What kind of thing are you?"**
