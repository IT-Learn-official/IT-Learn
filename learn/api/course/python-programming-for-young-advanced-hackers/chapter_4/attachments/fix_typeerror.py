# Mission: Fix the TypeError
#
# Right now, this script has a few TypeErrors because it mixes
# strings and numbers in the wrong way.
# Your job is to fix the code using int(), float(), and/or str()
# so that the script runs without errors and prints:
#
# Next year you will be 16
# Total score: 150
# Coins after bonus: 15

# --- Buggy snippet 1 ---
current_age = '15'
next_year = 1

# TODO: fix this so it prints: Next year you will be 16
# print('Next year you will be ' + current_age + next_year)

# --- Buggy snippet 2 ---
base_score = '100'
extra_score = 50

# TODO: fix this so it prints: Total score: 150
# print('Total score: ' + base_score + extra_score)

# --- Buggy snippet 3 ---
coins = '10'
bonus = 5

# TODO: fix this so it prints: Coins after bonus: 15
# print('Coins after bonus: ' + coins + bonus)
