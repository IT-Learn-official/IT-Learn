# Mission: Mini Shop Calculator
#
# You run a tiny shop. The price and quantity currently come in as strings.
# Your job is to:
#   1. Convert them to numbers using float() and int().
#   2. Multiply them to get a subtotal.
#   3. Print the subtotal.
#
# Expected output (or something very close):
# Subtotal: 29.97

price_str = '9.99'
quantity_str = '3'

# TODO: convert price_str to a float and quantity_str to an int
# price = ...
# quantity = ...

# TODO: calculate subtotal and print it
# subtotal = ...
# print('Subtotal:', subtotal)
