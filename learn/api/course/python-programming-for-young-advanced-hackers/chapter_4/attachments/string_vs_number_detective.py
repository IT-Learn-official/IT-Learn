# Mission: String vs Number Detective
#
# You are given some values that *look* like numbers, but are actually strings.
# Your job is to:
#   1. Convert them to real numbers using int() or float().
#   2. Do at least one calculation with them.
#   3. Print a short report with the results.

raw_age = '13'
raw_score = '250'
bonus = 5  # this is already an int

# TODO: convert raw_age and raw_score to real numbers
# age = ...
# score = ...

# TODO: calculate total_score using score and bonus
# total_score = ...

# TODO: print out the results similar to:
# Age: 13
# Score: 250
# Total score: 255
# Message: You are 13 years old and your score is 250
