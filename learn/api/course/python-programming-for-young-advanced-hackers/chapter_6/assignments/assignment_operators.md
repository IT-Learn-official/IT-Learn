# Mission: Assignment Operator Lab

Practice using assignment operators: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`.

## Instructions
1. Open the starter code in `attachments/assignment_operators.py`.
2. Start with a variable, then update it using each assignment operator and print the value after each change.
3. Make sure you have at least five print statements, one for each operator.
