# Mission: Count from 1 to 10

Use a for loop to count from 1 to 10.

## What your program should do

1. Use a `for` loop with `range()`.
2. Print the numbers 1, 2, 3, ... up to 10.
3. Do **not** write 10 separate `print` statements.

## Hints

- `range(1, 11)` generates numbers from 1 up to (but not including) 11.
