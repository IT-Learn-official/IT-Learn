# Mission: Count a Letter in a Word

Count how many times a certain letter appears in a word.

## What your program should do

1. Start with variables like:
   - `word = "hacker"`
   - `target_letter = "a"`
2. Use a `for` loop to look at each character in `word`.
3. Count how many times `target_letter` appears.
4. Print a message like:
   - `Found 1 times`

## Hints

- Use a counter variable, for example `count = 0` before the loop.
- Inside the loop, if `ch == target_letter`, increase the counter.
