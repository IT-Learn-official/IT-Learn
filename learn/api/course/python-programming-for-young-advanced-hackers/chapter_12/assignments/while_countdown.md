# Mission: Rocket Countdown

Use a while loop to count down and then launch the rocket.

## What your program should do

1. Start with a variable `count` (for example: `5`).
2. Use a `while` loop to print the numbers `count`, `count-1`, ... down to 1.
3. After the loop finishes, print `Liftoff!`.

## Hints

- The condition can be `while count > 0:`.
- Inside the loop, remember to do `count = count - 1` so it eventually stops.
