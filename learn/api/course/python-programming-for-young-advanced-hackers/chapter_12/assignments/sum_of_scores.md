# Mission: Add Up Scores

Add up a list of scores using a for loop.

## What your program should do

1. Start with a list of numbers, for example:
   - `scores = [10, 5, 7, 3]`
2. Create a variable `total` starting at 0.
3. Use a `for` loop to add each score to `total`.
4. Print the final total.

## Hints

- Inside the loop, do: `total = total + score`.
- Don't use the built-in `sum()` yet  practice the loop yourself.
