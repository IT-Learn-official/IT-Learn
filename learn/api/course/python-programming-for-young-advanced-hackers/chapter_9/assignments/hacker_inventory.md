# Mission: Hacker Inventory List

Manage your hacker tools using a list.

## What your program should do

1. Create a list called `inventory` with at least two starting items (for example, `"laptop"` and `"usb stick"`).
2. Print the **first** item and the **last** item using indexing.
3. Add at least one new item using `.append()`.
4. Loop over the list and print each item in a sentence, like:
   - `You have: laptop`

## Hints

- Remember: the first index is 0.
- Use `inventory[-1]` to get the last item.
- Use `for item in inventory:` to loop through the list.
