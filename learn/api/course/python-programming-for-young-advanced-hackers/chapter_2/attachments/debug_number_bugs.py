# Mission: Number Bug Hunter

# This file contains small buggy snippets. Your job is to fix them
# so the script runs without errors and prints correct results.

# BUG 1: Mixing text and numbers without conversion
# What do you think happens when you run this as-is?
age = 12
# TODO: Fix this line so it prints "You are 12 years old." without an error.
# print("You are " + age + " years old.")

# BUG 2: Typo in variable name
score = 10
# TODO: Fix the typo so the correct variable is printed.
# print(socre)

# BUG 3: Wrong operator in a math formula
price = 5
quantity = 3
# The total cost should be price times quantity.
# TODO: Fix the operator.
# total = price + quantity
# print("Total cost:", total)

# BUG 4: Missing parentheses changing the meaning of the math
# We want the result of (10 - 2) * 3.
# TODO: Fix the math so it matches the description.
# result = 10 - 2 * 3
# print("Result:", result)

# After fixing all the TODOs, run this file. It should print:
# You are 12 years old.
# 10
# Total cost: 15
# Result: 24
