# Mission: Name Your Secret Numbers
# TODO: Create some variables to hold your game stats.

# 1. Make at least three variables.
#    - One integer (like lives or coins)
#    - One float (like speed)
#    - One more number of your choice

# Example idea (you can change these):
# lives = 3
# speed = 1.5
# coins = 10

# 2. Use print to show each value with a label.
#    Try both styles:
#    - print("Lives:", lives)
#    - print("Lives: " + str(lives))

# Write your code below this line:
