# Mission: Number Bug Hunter

Real hackers don't just write code. They **debug**.

In this mission, you'll hunt down and fix small bugs in a script that uses variables and simple math.

---

## Your Task

1. Open the starter file `attachments/debug_number_bugs.py`.
2. The file contains several **broken** code snippets. Each one has a comment like `# BUG:` above it.
3. For each buggy snippet:
   - Read the code and the comment.
   - Predict what kind of error or wrong answer it might cause.
   - Fix the code so it runs correctly.

4. When you're done, the whole file should run **without errors** and print sensible results.

---

## Types of Bugs to Watch For

- Typo in a variable name (like `socre` instead of `score`).
- Using `+` when you meant `*` in a math formula.
- Forgetting to turn a number into a string before gluing it to text.
- Forgetting parentheses when you need to change the order of operations.

---

## Extra Challenge

- Above each fix, add a comment like:

  ```python
  # BUG FIXED: score variable was spelled wrong
  ```

- Make up one tiny bug of your own, try to guess what error message you'll get, then run the script and see if you were right.

> Achievement idea: You just leveled up from **coder** to **bug hunter**.
