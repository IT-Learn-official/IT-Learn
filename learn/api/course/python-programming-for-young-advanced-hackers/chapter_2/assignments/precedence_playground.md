# Mission: Parentheses Power-Up

In this mission, you get to play in an **expression lab**.

Your job: write some math expressions, guess what Python will print, and then use parentheses to **control the power**.

---

## Your Task

1. Open the starter file `attachments/precedence_playground.py`.
2. Add print statements with different expressions. Start with these pairs:

   ```python
   print("2 + 3 * 4 =", 2 + 3 * 4)
   print("(2 + 3) * 4 =", (2 + 3) * 4)

   print("10 - 4 / 2 =", 10 - 4 / 2)
   print("(10 - 4) / 2 =", (10 - 4) / 2)
   ```

3. **Before** you run the script, pause and guess the answers for each line.
4. Run the script and compare your guesses to the real outputs.

## Add Your Own Experiments

5. Add at least **two more** pairs of expressions:
   - One using `//` (integer division) or `%` (remainder).
   - One more of your choice.

For example:

```python
print("7 // 2 =", 7 // 2)
print("7 % 2 =", 7 % 2)
```

---

## Hints

- Remember the basic order (precedence):
  1. Parentheses `()`
  2. `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`
  3. `+`, `-`
- Use parentheses to **force** Python to do what you want first.

---

## Reflection

- Which expression surprised you the most?
- Did parentheses ever change the result from what you first guessed?

> Achievement idea: You just learned how to control math expressions like a **parentheses power user**.
