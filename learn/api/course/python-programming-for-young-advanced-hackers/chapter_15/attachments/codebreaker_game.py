#   - check_guess(self, guess): return "correct", "too low", or "too high"

# TODO: define class CodeBreaker
#   - __init__(self, name): set name and attempts
#   - guess(self, code, number): increment attempts, call code.check_guess, and print the result

# TODO: demo code
#   - create a Code and a CodeBreaker
