# Mission: Trace the Score

The score in this game changes as you play. Your job is to trace how the score changes by adding print statements after each update.

## Instructions
1. Open the starter code in `attachments/trace_the_score.py`.
2. Add print statements after each time the score changes.
3. Run the code and make sure your output matches:

```
Score: 0
Score: 10
Score: 15
```

## Example
If you see `score = score + 10`, add a print statement right after to show the new score.
