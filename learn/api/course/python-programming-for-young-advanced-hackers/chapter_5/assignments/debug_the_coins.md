# Mission: Debug the Coins

The code below is supposed to update the number of coins as you play, but the output is wrong. Use print-debugging to trace and fix the coin updates.

## Instructions
1. Open the starter code in `attachments/debug_the_coins.py`.
2. Add print statements to trace the value of `coins` after each change.
3. Fix any mistakes so the output is:

```
Start coins: 5
After buying a shield: 3
After finding treasure: 8
```
