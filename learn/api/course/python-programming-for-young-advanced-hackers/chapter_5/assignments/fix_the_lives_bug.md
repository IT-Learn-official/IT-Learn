# Mission: Fix the Lives Bug

This code is supposed to show how many lives you have left, but something is wrong! Fix the code so that it prints the correct number of lives after each change.

## Instructions
1. Open the starter code in `attachments/fix_the_lives_bug.py`.
2. Find and fix the bug so the output is:

```
Lives: 3
Lives: 2
Lives: 1
```

3. Add print statements after each change to show the value of `lives`.
