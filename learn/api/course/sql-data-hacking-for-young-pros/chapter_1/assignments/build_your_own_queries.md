# Assignment: Build Your Own Queries

## 🎯 Objective
Gain confidence by writing SQL queries independently based on real-world scenarios.

## 📋 Instructions

Read each scenario and write the appropriate SQL query. Think about what information is needed and which columns would provide that data.

---

## 🌟 Scenario 1: New Hacker Registration

**Context:** A new hacker just signed up for your platform. As an admin, you want to quickly check all registered hackers.

**Task:** Write a query to see all information about all hackers in the system.

```sql
-- Your query:
```

**Follow-up:** If you only needed to see usernames and email addresses (for sending a welcome email), what would the query look like?

```sql
-- Your modified query:
```

---

## 🎮 Scenario 2: Skill Catalog

**Context:** You're building a page that displays all available skills that hackers can learn.

**Task:** Write a query to retrieve all skills with their names, categories, and difficulty levels.

```sql
-- Your query:
```

**Follow-up:** If you wanted to create a simple list showing only skill names, what would that query be?

```sql
-- Your simplified query:
```

---

## 📊 Scenario 3: Leaderboard Preview

**Context:** You're designing a leaderboard and need to see hacker usernames along with their levels and experience points.

**Task:** Write a query that retrieves username, level, and xp_points from the hackers table.

```sql
-- Your query:
```

---

## 💼 Scenario 4: Project Dashboard

**Context:** Your team wants to review all ongoing projects to plan the next sprint.

**Task:** Write a query to see all project information.

```sql
-- Your query:
```

**Follow-up:** If you only need project names and their status (to create a quick status report), write that query:

```sql
-- Your status report query:
```

---

## 🔍 Scenario 5: Skill Points Calculator

**Context:** You want to know which skills give the most points to help hackers choose what to learn.

**Task:** Write a query to see skill names and their point values.

```sql
-- Your query:
```

---

## 🎯 Scenario 6: User Profile

**Context:** When a hacker clicks on their profile, you need to display their information.

**Task:** Write a query to retrieve username, email, level, and xp_points from the hackers table.

```sql
-- Your query:
```

---

## 📚 Scenario 7: Skills by Category

**Context:** You want to organize the skills page by showing each skill with its category.

**Task:** Write a query to get skill_name and category from the skills table.

```sql
-- Your query:
```

---

## 🚀 Scenario 8: Active Projects

**Context:** Management wants a list of all project names for a presentation.

**Task:** Write a query that returns only the project_name column from the projects table.

```sql
-- Your query:
```

---

## 🎓 Part 2: Create Your Own Scenarios

Now it's your turn! Create three scenarios and write the queries:

### Your Scenario 1:
**Context:** 
```
[Describe your scenario]
```

**Task:**
```
[Describe what data is needed]
```

**Query:**
```sql
-- Your query:
```

---

### Your Scenario 2:
**Context:** 
```
[Describe your scenario]
```

**Task:**
```
[Describe what data is needed]
```

**Query:**
```sql
-- Your query:
```

---

### Your Scenario 3:
**Context:** 
```
[Describe your scenario]
```

**Task:**
```
[Describe what data is needed]
```

**Query:**
```sql
-- Your query:
```

---

## 💡 Part 3: Query Planning

Before writing complex queries in the future, answer these planning questions:

1. **What information do I need?**
   - Which specific pieces of data will answer my question?

2. **Which table contains this information?**
   - Where is the data stored?

3. **Which columns do I need to select?**
   - What are the exact column names?

4. **Do I need all columns or specific ones?**
   - Should I use * or list columns?

---

## 🏆 Challenge: Query Translation

Translate these plain English requests into SQL queries:

### 1. "Show me everything about skills"
```sql

```

### 2. "I need the names and levels of all hackers"
```sql

```

### 3. "Get all the project details"
```sql

```

### 4. "Show me skill names with their difficulty ratings"
```sql

```

### 5. "List all hacker usernames"
```sql

```

## ✅ Self-Assessment

After completing all scenarios, rate yourself:

| Skill | Can't Do Yet | Need Practice | Got It! | Mastered! |
|-------|--------------|---------------|---------|-----------|
| Writing SELECT * queries | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |
| Selecting specific columns | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |
| Choosing the right columns for a task | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |
| Switching between different tables | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |
| Understanding what data to retrieve | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |

---

## 📊 Bonus: Query Comparison

Write two queries for the same goal using different approaches:

**Goal:** Get information about hackers

**Approach 1 (Get everything):**
```sql

```

**Approach 2 (Get only what you need: username, level):**
```sql

```

**Reflection:** Which approach is better? Why?
```
Your answer:
```

---

## 💭 Final Reflection

1. Which scenario was most realistic or interesting? Why?

2. How do you decide which columns to select?

3. When would you use `SELECT *` vs selecting specific columns?

4. What's your process for writing a new query?

## 🎯 Key Lessons

- **Think before you query**: Understand what data you need
- **Start simple**: Begin with familiar queries and build up
- **Be specific**: Select only the columns you need (when you know them)
- **Test as you go**: Run queries frequently to catch errors early
- **Real-world context helps**: Understanding why you need data makes writing queries easier

Congratulations! You can now write basic SQL SELECT queries for real-world scenarios! 🎉
