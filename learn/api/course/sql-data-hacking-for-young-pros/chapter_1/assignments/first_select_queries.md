# Assignment: Your First SELECT Queries

## 🎯 Objective
Master the basic SELECT statement by writing multiple queries to retrieve different data.

## 📋 Instructions

You have access to a table called `skills` that contains programming and hacking skills with their details.

### Exercise 1: See Everything
Write a query to display all columns and all rows from the `skills` table.

**Your Query:**
```sql
-- Write your SELECT * query here
```

**Expected Result:** You should see all available skills with all their information.

---

### Exercise 2: Just the Names
Sometimes you only need one piece of information. Write a query to display only the `skill_name` column.

**Your Query:**
```sql
-- Write your query to get only skill names
```

**Expected Result:** A single column showing all skill names.

---

### Exercise 3: Two Columns
Write a query to display both `skill_name` and `difficulty` columns from the skills table.

**Your Query:**
```sql
-- Write your query for two columns
```

**Expected Result:** Two columns showing skill names and their difficulty levels.

---

### Exercise 4: Three's Company
Write a query to display `skill_name`, `category`, and `points` columns.

**Your Query:**
```sql
-- Write your query for three columns
```

**Expected Result:** Three columns with skill details.

---

## ✅ Self-Check Questions

After running each query, ask yourself:
1. Did I get the expected columns?
2. Did I remember the semicolon?
3. Did I spell the column names correctly?
4. Did I use proper SQL syntax?

## 🎓 Bonus Challenges

1. **Column Order**: Try selecting the same columns but in a different order. What happens?
2. **All from Hackers**: Write a query to see all data from the `hackers` table.
3. **Mix and Match**: Create a query selecting any 4 columns from the `skills` table.

## 💡 Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ Forgetting the semicolon at the end
- ❌ Misspelling table or column names
- ❌ Using quotes around column names (usually not needed)
- ❌ Forgetting commas between column names

## 🏆 Success Criteria

You've mastered this assignment when you can:
- Write a SELECT * query without looking at examples
- Select multiple specific columns with proper syntax
- Retrieve data from different tables confidently
- Identify and fix simple syntax errors

## 📝 Reflection

Write down your answers:
1. What's the difference between `SELECT *` and `SELECT column_name`?
2. Why might you want to select only specific columns instead of all columns?
3. What error messages did you encounter, and how did you fix them?
