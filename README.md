# ⌨️ IT Learn

## Welcome to IT Learn!

IT Learn is a project we started to make learning code a bit easier and more fun.  
Anyone can use it. It does not matter if you are just starting or already know some basics.

Right now you can learn:

- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  
- Python  
- And more!

We are still building and improving things, so the site will keep changing over time.

If you want to contribute, please only create pull requests to the **new-beta** branch.  
Pull requests to the **main** branch will be rejected (Broodje doesn't like it...).
